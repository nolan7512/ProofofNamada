#Shielded pool rewards

Upon reviewing the specification document again, one potential theoretical flaw is the lack of detail regarding the implementation of the PD (proportional-derivative) controllers for assets and the target shielded amounts configured by Namada governance.

Here's an analysis of this potential flaw:

Potential for Exploitation: If the PD controllers are not appropriately designed or calibrated, there's a possibility that users could exploit loopholes or weaknesses in the reward allocation mechanism. For example, they might identify ways to artificially inflate the perceived amount of assets in the shielded pool to maximize their rewards without actually contributing to privacy.


To address this potential flaw,  it should outline strategies for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of these controllers to ensure they achieve the desired outcomes without unintended consequences.

#=====================================================================================================================================
#PGF stewards

One theoretical flaw in the specification document is the potential for centralization of power within the PGF stewards. While the document outlines a governance process for electing and removing stewards, it doesn't address the possibility of collusion or concentration of power among a small group of stewards.

In the document, it's mentioned that for StewardProposal, if at least 2/3 of the voting power voted on the proposal and more than half of the votes are against the proposal, the steward is removed from the set of stewards. However, this mechanism could potentially lead to governance gridlock or instability.

Consider a scenario where a minority group with a large amount of voting power consistently votes against every proposal, including proposals to remove stewards. In such a case, the governance process could become paralyzed, as even though a majority of voters may support removing a steward, the proposal could fail due to the minority group's voting power.

This flaw could hinder the effectiveness of the governance system in efficiently removing underperforming or inactive stewards, as the threshold for removing stewards is set quite high and vulnerable to manipulation by well-funded minority groups.

Since PGF stewards have significant control over the allocation of public funds and the direction of the project, the concentration of power among a small group could lead to decisions that prioritize their interests over those of the broader community. This could result in unfair distribution of funds, lack of transparency, and reduced accountability.

Additionally, the document doesn't specify mechanisms for ensuring diversity among stewards or preventing conflicts of interest. Without proper checks and balances, there's a risk that stewards could act in their own self-interest rather than in the best interest of the community.



To mitigate this flaw, the governance process could include measures such as:

Transparency requirements: Requiring stewards to publicly disclose their affiliations, financial interests, and potential conflicts of interest.
Rotation of stewards: Implementing term limits or rotation policies to prevent long-term concentration of power among a small group of stewards.
Diversity requirements: Ensuring that stewards represent a diverse range of backgrounds, perspectives, and interests within the community.
Accountability mechanisms: Establishing mechanisms for community members to hold stewards accountable for their actions, such as regular reporting requirements or the ability to recall stewards through a community vote.
By addressing these concerns, the governance process can help ensure that PGF stewards act in the best interest of the Namada community and promote fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in decision-making.

#================================================================================================================================
Another potential issue is the lack of controls and oversight over the use of public funds. The document mentions that PGF stewards have the ability to propose and spend funds from the public treasury without providing specific measures to ensure that these expenditures are used responsibly and transparently.


To address this issue, the following measures could be implemented:
Financial controls: Establish a process for reviewing and approving expenditure proposals from PGF stewards. These proposals should be carefully reviewed and approved by an independent body or financial management agency before being implemented.

Regular reporting: Require PGF stewards to provide regular reports on the use of public funds and the outcomes of funded projects. These reports should be transparent and publicly disclosed so that the community can monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of fund utilization.

Independent auditing: Conduct independent audits and inspections of the use of public funds to ensure that procedures and expenditures comply with established principles and regulations.
By implementing such controls and checks, the Namada project can ensure that the use of public funds is carried out transparently, responsibly, and effectively.

The theoretical flaws in the namada specification I mentioned in previous "Building protocol improvements" task. I hope these two tasks of mine can complement each other

I applied the theoretical flaws and holes in this logic to token appropriation in the PGF Treasury

I proposed a proposal for a huge amount of money, and it was easily passed, because most people only read the first part and CLI or UI queries do not display Continuous or Retroactive content and other flaws I have found. mentioned in the attached link. I wrote it pretending to be an improvement by the Namada and Helixa dev teams, but the content of Continuous,Retroactive called for a huge amount of tokens.

   Continuous: Add(Internal address=tnam1qqnarl4h6dsy4jchy0tcxakh286ec03weyfnks6e, amount=200000000000000)

- In Namada specs mentioned :
+ Becoming a steward
  The first step towards becoming a Steward is to instantiate a multisignature account. (https://specs.namada.net/modules/governance/public-goods-funding/becoming-a-steward)
+ but in the code there is no check for multisig, even whether the manager is  1-out-of-1 multisig , it should be checked to be consistent with namada specs

After I shared this, in telegram group : Namada VietNam, player: tnam1qrhnj4cw0d6agek9v8yxs3p2arxynmc3ucn5ekua
trying to steal my quest using Proposal-id 315. Any player submitting Task S with proof proposal-id 315 is a copy.
Meanwhile I have done this at Proposal-id 260.
Hope the Namada dev team checks for duplicate tasks and submission time. To avoid brain theft, and help keep the game fair
